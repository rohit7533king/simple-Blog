  <h1>Git and Github</h1>
  <p>So we can talk about git and github. Git and Github are different form each other. Firstly we will talk
    about Git. So git is popular and its called as version control system mainly used by profesional developers to
    have proper control over the projects. In Git you can config your name and email to make projects on github. So
    if you want initialize a git repository first you will have to create a repository and then git init so it will
    initialize a empty repository . Now you have to know about untracked and staged file its nothing much which tracks your
    files and tell whether you have done any changes.So there are 4 types u need to know untracked, unmodified,
    modified, staged. In untracked whether file is untracked you have to track them by typing git add . after adding file
    it will go to staged area where you can commit by typing First commit ctrl+enter. If you wanna undo any file where
    you deleted file by mistakely you can type git checkout in git bash. let talk about git status its nothing much to
    check status about ur file . Git log show that what you have commited in your project .Git diff is which compare working directory
    to staged directory. RM command is used to delete or remove the file from your project. Git ignore will ignore the unwanted
    file. Branches is very good feature in git .In branches the default branch is the master branch so where you can create
    another branch work on it without messing the master branch and later you can merge them with your own branch</p>
